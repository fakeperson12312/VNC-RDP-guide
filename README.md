# VNC_guide
So I was messing around one day with docker, and I stumbled upon this wonderful thingy: https://hub.docker.com/r/dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc
It turns out to actually have a good fps if your computer is good enough (my linux comp that could run stuff wasn't good but the mac one that couldn't run alot of stuff was good)
Basically, I got a vnc/rdp way that mostly has good fps and can run alot of programs. It's even more if the operating system was linux and it supported kvm. Yes, I know about 
using VMs with multipass on docker and doing it there, along with setting KVM=N for my docker compose files, but eh ill do that later. 
# Commands
To be put in later because i'm too lazy to copy and paste a docker-compose.yml file
